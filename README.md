 Autocorrelation Plot
What it shows:
This plot measures the correlation of the temperature series with itself at different lags—essentially asking: "How predictable is the temperature based on previous values?"

##Key Insights:

Strong autocorrelation at short lags: Indicates that yesterday’s temperature is a good predictor of today’s.

Seasonal cyclic pattern: After ~4000–5000 lags (likely ~6 months in hourly data), the autocorrelation dips and rises again—indicating repeating yearly cycles.

Essential for model choice: Validates the use of time series models like ARIMA or Prophet that rely on autocorrelation patterns.

##Summary for EDA Section:
The exploratory analysis reveals strong seasonal trends in temperature and relative humidity, with temperature peaking mid-year and humidity showing an inverse relationship. Wind speed varies more erratically with less seasonal dependence. The autocorrelation plot confirms temporal dependence and seasonality in temperature, validating the use of time series forecasting methods. Overall, this analysis uncovers valuable patterns crucial for model building and climate interpretation.

## 3. Correlation Analysis

### Objective
To identify and visualize relationships between temperature and other variables like humidity, wind speed, and pressure.

### Insights
- Temperature negatively correlates with humidity.
- Moderate patterns found with wind speed and pressure.
- Supports model input selection.

- <img width="790" height="640" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 144504" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9da818f4-5ae7-4183-91b8-1e7d6d6341d5" />
Correlation Matrix of Weather Variables
What it shows:
This heatmap displays the Pearson correlation coefficients between weather variables including:

Temperature (Temp_C)

Relative Humidity (Rel Hum_%)

Wind Speed (Wind Speed_km/h)

Pressure (Press_kPa)

Key Insights:

Temperature vs Relative Humidity: Correlation = -0.22
→ Indicates a weak negative correlation — as temperature increases, relative humidity tends to decrease, and vice versa.

Temperature vs Pressure: Correlation = -0.24
→ Also weakly negative, suggesting that higher temperatures are slightly associated with lower atmospheric pressure.

Wind Speed vs Pressure: Correlation = -0.36
→ This is the strongest relationship in the matrix, albeit still moderate. Lower pressures may correspond to higher wind speeds, often a sign of storms or fronts.

Low interdependencies overall
→ Most variables are not strongly correlated, meaning they can act as mostly independent predictors in machine learning models.

Conclusion:
This matrix helps in selecting features for predictive modeling by showing how related variables are — avoiding multicollinearity and ensuring more robust models.

<img width="590" height="467" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 144512" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/299c8fb3-4427-4580-8400-a3e9761124a3" />
Temperature vs Relative Humidity
What it shows:
A scatter plot mapping temperature (x-axis) against relative humidity (y-axis).

Key Insights:

The cloud of points tilts downward slightly, confirming the negative correlation seen in the matrix.

High humidity tends to occur at lower temperatures, while higher temperatures are often associated with lower humidity.

This inverse relationship is expected due to the capacity of warm air to hold more moisture, which causes relative humidity to appear lower at higher temperatures.

Conclusion:
This inverse relationship can be leveraged in temperature or humidity forecasting models and validates physical atmospheric behavior.

<img width="586" height="420" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 144520" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27e5e8b5-45f4-4a68-8367-221d8ed59e6e" />
Temperature vs Wind Speed
What it shows:
This scatter plot shows the relationship between temperature and wind speed.

Key Insights:

There is no strong linear relationship; the spread appears mostly uniform across the temperature range.

However, slightly higher wind speeds are observed at colder temperatures, potentially due to stormy or front-driven weather patterns in winter.

Many values are concentrated below 20 km/h, indicating typical wind conditions.

Conclusion:
Wind speed doesn’t strongly correlate with temperature but may still hold predictive value in non-linear models or when combined with pressure data.

<img width="567" height="423" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 144528" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11329666-318e-407e-86c3-c674b360534d" />
Temperature vs Pressure
What it shows:
A scatter plot of temperature against atmospheric pressure.

Key Insights:

A slightly negative trend is visible — lower pressures are more likely during warmer days.

The spread is tighter than the wind plot, showing more consistent behavior.

Weather systems with lower pressure (e.g., storms or warm fronts) often bring higher temperatures, while high-pressure systems are often cooler and more stable.

Conclusion:
This relationship may be useful in weather classification or short-term forecasting, especially in storm detection models.


 Summary for the Correlation Analysis Section:
The correlation analysis shows that temperature is weakly negatively correlated with relative humidity and atmospheric pressure. Wind speed displays a moderate negative relationship with pressure, which can be useful in identifying stormy or windy conditions. While no single variable exhibits a strong linear dependency with others, these subtle patterns inform feature selection for predictive models. The scatter plots help visualize these relationships and confirm atmospheric behaviors observed in practice.

## 4. Weather Condition Frequency Analysis

### Objective
To quantify and visualize the most and least common weather types.

### Insights
- Clear and cloudy conditions dominate.
- Rare events (e.g., thunderstorms) occur sporadically.
- Helps categorize training data and forecast likelihoods.

- <img width="975" height="620" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 145056" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb44e48c-d9e5-40d9-a784-14fb02089e2d" />

 Weather Condition Frequency
What it shows:
This horizontal bar chart displays the count of occurrences for each unique weather condition recorded in the dataset. It is sorted in descending order of frequency, helping quickly identify the most and least common weather patterns.

 Key Observations:
 Dominant Conditions
Mainly Clear, Mostly Cloudy, and Cloudy are the most frequent conditions.

These three categories account for a majority of observations, reflecting typical day-to-day weather in many temperate climates.

Clear skies also appear often, indicating periods of no cloud cover and possibly higher temperatures.

 Moderately Frequent Conditions
Snow, Rain, and Rain Showers occur regularly but are less common than clear/cloudy skies.

This aligns with expectations in climates where snow and rain are seasonal or tied to specific weather events (e.g., winter storms, spring rains).

 Rare Events
Many entries like Freezing Rain, Thunderstorms, Blowing Snow, or mixed conditions such as Snow, Ice Pellets appear only a handful of times.

These represent extreme or transitional weather events and may carry more importance in anomaly detection or classification tasks despite their rarity.

 Data Complexity
Some categories are compound conditions (e.g., "Rain,Fog", "Snow,Blowing Snow"), indicating weather sensor or reporting systems often record multiple simultaneous phenomena.

Depending on your use case, these may need preprocessing (e.g., splitting or regrouping into broader categories like “rainy” or “hazardous”).

 Why This Matters:
Data Imbalance: The chart reveals imbalanced class distributions, where a few categories dominate (e.g., "Mainly Clear"), and many are underrepresented.

This is important for machine learning, especially classification, as imbalance can lead to biased models.

Forecasting Context: Understanding common vs. rare events helps in probabilistic forecasting — e.g., predicting the likelihood of rain on a given day.

Training Strategy: Rare conditions might need oversampling or special handling during model training to avoid underfitting those classes.

Climatic Insight: From a climate perspective, this plot offers a high-level view of the region’s typical weather behavior.

 Summary for weather condition frequency analysis:
The weather condition frequency analysis highlights that mainly clear, mostly cloudy, and cloudy days dominate the dataset, reflecting a typical day-to-day pattern in temperate regions. Conditions like rain, snow, and fog occur moderately, while rare and extreme events (e.g., thunderstorms, freezing rain) are infrequent. These insights are critical for understanding weather distributions, informing forecasting models, and addressing class imbalance challenges in machine learning applications.

## 5. Anomaly Detection

### Objective
To identify extreme values or outliers in temperature and pressure.

### Insights
- Z-score thresholding detects statistical anomalies.
- Visual plots show when unusual weather occurred.
- Can be linked to events or data quality issues.

  <img width="1484" height="638" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 145633" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eaee1b6-b427-4c8a-adc9-9eb1852b99ca" />

   Anomaly Detection in Temperature and Pressure
This visualization consists of two side-by-side time series plots:

Left Panel: Temperature (Temp_C) over time

Right Panel: Pressure (Press_kPa) over time
In both plots, anomalies are highlighted as red dots, while the original data is plotted in blue.

 Left Panel: Anomaly Detection in Temperature
What it shows:

The blue line represents daily/hourly temperature fluctuations across the year 2012.

Red dots indicate anomalies — points that deviate significantly from the expected temperature values based on a statistical threshold (likely Z-score or IQR method).

Key Insights:

Most temperature outliers occur at extreme highs and lows, especially during winter (Jan, Dec) and late spring/early summer.

A few sharp, sudden temperature jumps or drops are marked as anomalies, possibly due to:

Sudden cold or heat waves

Sensor errors or missing value imputation

Localized microclimate phenomena

Why it matters:

Identifying abnormal temperature events is useful for extreme weather warning systems, quality control, and event correlation (e.g., energy surges, crop damage, health risks).

 Right Panel: Anomaly Detection in Pressure
What it shows:

The blue line tracks atmospheric pressure (kPa) over the same time period.

Red dots represent detected anomalies in pressure.

Key Insights:

Anomalies mostly occur at the lower or upper extremes of pressure values.

Notably, several anomalies are concentrated:

Early in the year (Jan–Feb): Possible indication of low-pressure systems (e.g., storms)

Late in the year (Nov–Dec): Includes a spike above 103 kPa — possibly a high-pressure ridge.

These anomalies could correspond to weather fronts, sensor calibration errors, or data entry issues.

Why it matters:

Pressure anomalies are often precursors to storm systems or unusual weather behavior.

Detecting them early helps enhance forecast accuracy, especially for wind speed and precipitation models.

 Summary for Anomaly Detection Section:
The anomaly detection process effectively highlights irregular patterns in temperature and pressure data. In temperature, most anomalies occur at extreme highs or lows, aligning with unusual weather events or data spikes. Pressure anomalies, while less frequent, cluster at low or high extremes, potentially signaling storm systems or sensor deviations. This detection aids in identifying extreme weather events, ensuring data quality, and informing risk-based forecasting systems.

## 6. Temperature Variation Visualization

### Objective
To understand how temperature fluctuates over time dimensions (hourly, weekly, seasonally).

### Insights
- Daily heat cycles are evident.
- Monthly and seasonal visualizations reflect natural climate cycles.

  <img width="1170" height="631" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 150010" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d33bcddc-d164-4237-8d42-798e7c961da6" />
   Temperature by Hour of Day
What it shows:

This plot displays how temperature varies throughout the 24-hour daily cycle.

Each box represents the distribution of temperature values for each hour of the day.

Key Insights:

Lowest temperatures typically occur between 3 AM and 7 AM, as expected due to the lack of solar heating overnight.

Highest temperatures occur between 2 PM and 5 PM, peaking after midday due to delayed heat absorption from sunlight.

This diurnal cycle (daily warming and cooling) is consistent across all seasons.

Conclusion:
Understanding these hourly patterns is crucial for energy management, health risk alerts, and activity planning during peak heat or cold hours.

<img width="1186" height="658" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 150019" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a380ae1e-b73a-42a5-8685-9884172028fd" />
Temperature by Day of Week
What it shows:

This plot compares temperature distributions across the days of the week (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday).

Key Insights:

The distributions are almost identical across all days, indicating that temperature is independent of the weekday.

There’s no systematic difference between weekdays and weekends in terms of temperature variation.

Conclusion:
This reinforces the idea that calendar days do not affect weather, and weekly cycles don’t need to be modeled for temperature predictions.


<img width="1190" height="617" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 150029" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fbd6acf-3ddc-40f2-8d5f-771b2c806d5b" />
Temperature by Month
What it shows:

This plot shows the temperature variation across the 12 months of the year.

Each box indicates the spread of temperature values for that specific month.

Key Insights:

There is a clear seasonal pattern:

January & February: Coldest months with temperatures frequently below zero.

June–August: Warmest months with medians near or above 20°C.

Transitional months (March–May and September–November) show wider variability and more outliers, reflecting unstable weather.

Conclusion:
Monthly trends are vital for seasonal forecasting, agricultural planning, and climate zone analysis.


<img width="1190" height="657" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 150039" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bae9c676-46b2-4223-8369-dbc5208d1821" />
Temperature by Season
What it shows:

This plot aggregates temperatures into the four seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall.

Key Insights:

Summer shows the highest temperatures, tightly clustered around the 20–25°C range.

Winter is the coldest, with a median well below zero and a large spread — reflecting greater temperature variability.

Spring and Fall display transitional behavior, with a wider interquartile range and more outliers (abrupt warm or cold events).

Conclusion:
Season-based aggregation helps in modeling broad climate behavior and is useful for energy use prediction, infrastructure planning, or public health strategies (e.g., heat stroke alerts, hypothermia risk).

Final Summary for the Temperature Variation Section:
The visual exploration of temperature variation across hours, days, months, and seasons reveals strong diurnal and seasonal cycles. While weekday variations are minimal, monthly and seasonal patterns are distinct, with warmer temperatures in summer and cold extremes in winter. These visualizations help inform model design, alert systems, and time-aware feature engineering in forecasting models.

### Objective
To forecast weather variables using ARIMA and Prophet models.

### Insights
- ARIMA effectively models short-term patterns.
- Prophet confirms seasonal strength.
- Provides 7-day forecasts with confidence intervals.

- <img width="1478" height="962" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-29 153900" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/135ab0d3-8adb-4771-8b03-7f26fc9bc90c" />
Time Series Forecasting of Weather Variables
This figure presents 7-day ahead forecasts of three key weather variables — Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure — using historical data from 2012. The forecasting method employed here is the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, which is commonly used for time series prediction due to its ability to capture temporal structure.

The forecast includes:

Actual observed data in blue

Forecasted values in color (red for temperature, green for humidity, orange for pressure)

Confidence intervals (CI) as shaded regions, showing the range of uncertainty around the predictions

1. Temperature Forecast (Top Plot)
The blue line represents daily average temperature throughout 2012.

Toward the end of the year, a 7-day forecast is shown in red.

The pink shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval of the forecast.

Insights:

The model accurately captures the seasonal trend, showing warmer temperatures in the middle of the year (summer) and a cooling trend toward December.

The forecast suggests that temperature is expected to remain relatively stable or slightly decrease in early January.

The confidence interval is reasonably narrow, indicating good model confidence.

2. Humidity Forecast (Middle Plot)
The blue line shows historical relative humidity (%).

The green segment at the end represents the 7-day forecast.

The light blue shaded region shows the forecast uncertainty.

Insights:

Humidity levels appear to fluctuate frequently, lacking a strong seasonal trend.

The ARIMA model captures the short-term oscillatory nature of humidity.

The confidence interval is slightly wider, indicating more variability and uncertainty in predicting humidity.

 3. Pressure Forecast (Bottom Plot)
The blue line represents atmospheric pressure (in kPa).

The orange line shows the 7-day forecast.

The green shaded band represents the prediction interval.

Insights:

Atmospheric pressure shows less pronounced trends but some periodic variation.

The model predicts a modest rise in pressure over the forecast period.

The confidence band is tight, indicating that the model is relatively confident in its short-term pressure predictions.

 Summary on Time Series Analysis:
These plots demonstrate the effectiveness of time series models like ARIMA in forecasting short-term weather variables. While temperature and pressure show strong seasonal or stable patterns, humidity appears more erratic. The forecasts are enhanced by confidence intervals, which convey uncertainty — a critical feature for weather applications. These insights can be used in climate-aware decision-making, event planning, or early warning systems.
